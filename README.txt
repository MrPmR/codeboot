The codeBoot IDE is a browser-based development environment aimed at novice programmers.  It currently supports the JavaScript programming language.

Its main features are:

- no need to install anything on the client computer
- can run locally without an internet connection
- console for interactive experimentation and debugging
- code editor and persistent integrated file system
- single-step mode with step counter
- code highlighting for stepping and error messages
- "novice" setting restricts the language for pedagogical reasons
- code editors can be saved to short URLs (useful for embedding executable
  code samples in web pages and PDF documents)



To install : 
- You first need npm (Node package manager)
- Run npm install to use package.json
- Run npm start to start codeboot


Using your own dropbox application :
- Create config.js based on config.js.sample with your keys
- Make sure you ran npm install
- Configure your port on app.js
